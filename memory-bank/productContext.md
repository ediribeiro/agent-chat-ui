Describe why this project exists, the problems it solves, and the intended user experience.

## Problem Statement
This project solves the problem of efficiently analyzing public procurement documents for risk, providing transparent, real-time feedback and actionable reporting to users.

- Manual risk analysis of procurement documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks transparency.
- Stakeholders (procurement officers, auditors, managers) need a tool that provides clear, traceable, and interactive risk assessments.
- Users require a way to upload documents, observe the analysis process, and receive structured outputs (including downloadable reports).

## User Experience Goals
- Users should experience a seamless, interactive chat interface for document upload, analysis, and feedback.
- Real-time streaming of AI reasoning and results, making the process transparent and engaging.
- Clear presentation of risk findings, with the ability to download results and request minor adjustments.
- Simple, modern UI with intuitive controls and feedback at every step.
- Users should experience a step-by-step dashboard for risk analysis, with clear workflow visualization, progress tracking, and agent logs.
- All interactions should be intuitive, accessible, and visually consistent with modern UI standards.
- Exporting and reviewing reports should be seamless within the dashboard context.
